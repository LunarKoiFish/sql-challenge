# sql-challenge

In this challenge, we are tasked with the role of being a data engineer at a company. Our goal is to design tables that can hold data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into our PostgreSQL database, and then conducting a data analysis on the data.

This task was completed using PgAdmin to data model tables and preparing them for data import. Once the tables schemas were made in PgAdmin, the CSV data was imported into each of their tables respectively. After all the data has been imported, we began data analysis by answering question about the data. For the analysis we quered specific data from the tables we wanted to see such as hiring date or by certain names.

There were some struggles trying to figure out the data analysis part. Some of the specific questions were a bit tricky to figure out. With some help of Xpert Learning Assistant, it was able to guide and teach me on how to query the right data. There were also code used from previous activities that helped me through the challenge as well.
